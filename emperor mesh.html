           <h2>mesh's biography</h2>
           <p>June 8th 2005,in the raining night , the sky was shining with lightning,the storm made trees to meander while their leaves shaking violently,the roar of thunder catapulted across the whole village.That's when a cry of a newborn baby was heard.Despite of all hindrance of bad weather, everyone inthe village heard his voice.The mother knew that she has given birth to a <em> legend </em> The father knew that whoever, she has brought in this world is <b> extraordinary</b>.The villagers hated to admit that their <i>saviour</i> a <sub> mighty </sub> hero is <sup> born </sup> foretellers,witches and everyone who was gifted with the ability to foretell the future, knew that a <sup>legend</sup> been brought into this world.
           <p> <em>...back to reality </em> </p>
           <p> In reality mesh is a loner,the saddest being to exist.He utterly hates people,he likes computers more than people.The boredom seem to be his way of life.Poverty being his life partner, he sometimes feel unlucky to be have been born.He can't bare women even a second.He is mentally wrecked and too toxic to tolerate.All he knows is that he was <b> born to suffer </b>.
